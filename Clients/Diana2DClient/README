LINUX USERS:
===============

Pre-compiled binaries can be found in 
./Clients/Diana2DClient/Diana2DClient/bin/Debug/

To run the client, on Ubuntu, you will need to install

mono-complete
mono-vbnc (apparently mono-complete is not that complete)


Then run the .exe with mono, a la

mono Clients/Diana2DClient/Diana2DClient/bin/Debug/Diana2DClient.exe
